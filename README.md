# Air Canada React + Shopify JS API
This is an example for Air Canada on what can be done with React and the Shopify Javascript API. This package includes the followiing:

- Node (NPM)
- React
- Shopify Javascript API
- Webpack (Node SASS)
- Babel
- ESlint

This is a simple App that uses async fetch functions to connect to a test store on my development server. The products are pulled from the admin section and can be customized in any way. I wanted to show a routed set up inside react that can pull a list of products and have you click on each to pull the individual product data with a url match. From there you can select the variants options and quantity and add it to a cart.

A couple things I would add if I had more time:

- Redux implementation to have a consistent cart across all pages
- Global loading states through Redux
- User Authentication
- Profile Section
